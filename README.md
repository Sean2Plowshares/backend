## What is Praelatus?

Praelatus is a modern bug tracker and ticketing system inspired by JIRA, BugZilla, and the many support ticketing systems members of the Core Team have used throughout their careers.

Grown from frustration with today’s disparate and difficult methods of bug reporting, Praelatus aims to simplify the way other [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) projects operate. Through intuitive workflows and support for “Internet Driver’s License” accounts such as Github, Google, and Twitter, we want any user to be able to submit a ticket in three clicks or less – including account creation – without the need of a user manual.

## Contributing

The basics:

1. Fork it! :fork_and_knife:
2. Create an issue describing what you're working on.
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
6. :fire: Submit a pull request :D :fire:

All pull requests should go to the develop branch not master. Thanks!

## Installation

Praelatus really doesn't do anything yet!`

## Configuration

I will write configuration documentation when Praelatus has stabilized a bit.
